## Welcome to Draco's GitHub Pages via Jekyll

Thanks for Zhengpeng's recommendation, I stopped the wordpress blog and made some effort to set up the Github Pages as my homepage.


`The best is: it's free !!! `

I will spend some more time to master it in soon future. 

Besides, Github Pages can work very well with Obsidian, in which I'm typing these words.
